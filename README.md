# Indian_Tourism_AR
This project promotes Indian tourism via a virtual platform using AR and AI. Users can search tourist locations, explore them in 360Â° Street Views, and interact with an AI chat system for insights. Built with Google Maps API and a Flask backend, it makes cultural heritage accessible globally.
